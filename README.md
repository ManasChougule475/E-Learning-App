# E-Learning App :-
# Objective :-
The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly e-learning platform using React, incorporating dynamic routing and video content to provide an engaging and accessible learning experience.

# Description:
This is a simple E-Learning React application designed to provide an interactive learning experience for users. 

1. **React Router Integration**: The app uses React Router for smooth page navigation.

2. **Navigation Buttons**: Users can easily switch between different pages using navigation buttons.

3. **Dynamic routes to show course details**: Within the "Course" section, dynamic routes are employed. Clicking on any course displays its detailed information, streamlining the user's understanding of the available courses without the need to create separate details pages for each course.

4. **useOutletContext Hook**: This hook is essential to display details of each chapter within a course , providing a structured learning experience.

5. **Video Learning** : Users have the ability to view video content, enhancing the learning experience with multimedia resources.

This project serves as a practical example of creating an e-learning platform with React, showcasing different functionalities.
