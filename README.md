# E-Learning App :-
# Objective :-
The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly e-learning platform using React, incorporating dynamic routing and video content to provide an engaging and accessible learning experience.

# Description:
This is a simple E-Learning React application designed to provide an interactive learning experience for users. 

1. **React Router Integration**: The app uses React Router for smooth page navigation.

2. **Navigation Buttons**: Users can easily switch between different pages using navigation buttons.

3. **Dynamic routes to show course details**: Within the "Course" section, dynamic routes are employed. Clicking on any course displays its detailed information, streamlining the user's understanding of the available courses without the need to create separate details pages for each course.

4. **useOutletContext Hook**: This hook is essential to display details of each chapter within a course , providing a structured learning experience.

5. **Video Learning** : Users have the ability to view video content, enhancing the learning experience with multimedia resources.

This project serves as a practical example of creating an e-learning platform with React, showcasing different functionalities.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
